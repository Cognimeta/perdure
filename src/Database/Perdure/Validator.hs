-- Although most hash functions are defined on strings of byte as a convention, they often start by converting the plaintext to strings
-- of 32 or 64 bit words. They may do the reverse with the output. We will restrict ourselves to such hash functions (stripped of their
-- intial and final byte conversions) so that we may apply them with equal efficiency, and identical results, on either big-endian or
-- little-endian platforms. The buffers we hash are made up of 32bit or 64bit words. This also allows for a clean design where byte conversion
-- (when needed due to the interoperation of systems of different endianness) occurs after hashing when writing, and before
-- hashing when reading. We do not have readily available implementations of the hash functions with the byte conversion layer stripped, so
-- we will use a (64-bit) hash function with a little endian byte-conversion layer (such as tiger of skein-512 from 
-- http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash-0.6.2), and add an additional byte-swap layers when we are on big-endian machines.
-- When we have time we can optimize big-endian machines by reworking the code of the library. For 32 bit platforms we will
-- use a 32 bit optimized hash algorithm, with a digest of the same size. When reading we will need to know both the endianness
-- in which the data was written, but also the word size (and thus the hash algorithm) of the written data.
